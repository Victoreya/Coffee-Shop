## I created a database for an online Cinema booking system using MySQL. 

It consists of 7 tables of data. Those tables are:
Films: 100 different ones
Customers: First and last name, phone number, email, and ID number
Rooms: different rooms numbers for the theatre 
Screenings: How many movies are going at a time or are available 
Bookings: Dates and times throughout the past 2 years  
Reseverd seats: different rows of assigned seating   
.
I Utilized Aggregate functions and Subqueries for extracting multiple sets of data from different tables to get the desired results.
